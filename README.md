## by Israel Daniel

> This data set contains 113,937 loans with 81 variables on each loan, including loan amount, borrower rate (or interest rate), current loan status, borrower income, and many others.. The dataset can be found [here](https://s3.amazonaws.com/udacity-hosted-downloads/ud651/prosperLoanData.csv),

## Summary of Findings

Exploratory steps were taken to identify relationships between variables of interest like income range, employment status, loan terms, loan status, borrower rates, monthly loan payments and monthly loan amounts among others.
It was discovered that most richer borrowers had the best risk scores as expected. Also, terms of 12 months which was the shortest had lower interest rates on them compared to other terms. Terms of 36 months were the most frequent with a percentage of 69%.
Most of the loans exhibits low interest rates. Although, some of the original loan amounts below 15,000 tend to have very high rates which I think is as a result or high risk scores. 
Retired borrowers had low interest rates, employed borrowers had and average rate while unemployed borrowers had the highest rates.


## Key Insights for Presentation

For the presentation, I focus on the loan terms, employment status, prosper score, borrower apr, borrower rate and income range of borrowers.
For the loan terms, loans of 36 months had a very high frequency of 69% compared to other terms, with loan terms of 60 months following with a much lower frequency of 29% and 12 months falling behind with a small frequency of just 2%. 
While exploring, it was discovered that average earners to tend to fall under the risk scores from 1.0 - 8.0 of which they led in those scores among other earners, the richer borrowers usually had the best risk scores due to their earning potential.
It was also discovered that most of the original loan amounts had low interest rates, with some of them below 15,000 having very high rates.
Terms and Employment Status had an influence with the interest rates which was expected except for the terms which was discovered. Retired borrowers had the lowest rates in both Borrower rates and borrower APRs while not-employed borrowers had the highest rates in average. Part-time and Full-time borrowers tend to have similar rates across the different terms. Also, terms of 12 months tend to have the lowest rates among both the borrower rate and borrower apr.
